# üìÇ My personal dotfiles

## üì¶ Installation
To install these configuration files you need [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/#one-line-binary-install) installed on your system.  
The following command installs chezmoi and automatically applies the dotfiles:  
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS chezmoi.io/get)" -- init --apply sparcopt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è App configs
This repository manages configurations for the following applications:  

- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
- [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)

## üíª Setup
Follow this steps if you want to customize your CLI like mine:  

1. **[shell]** Install zsh  
   - ```sudo apt-get update```  
   - ```sudo apt-get install zsh -y```   
   - ```chsh -s $(which zsh)``` (make it the default shell)   
   - Log out and log back in again to use your new default shell
2. **[prompt]** Install oh-my-posh  
   - I used homebrew but there are other ways to install it (homebrew is recommended as my prompt configuration is linked to homebrew)
   - ```brew tap jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh```  
   - ```brew install oh-my-posh```  
3. **[icons]** Install LSDeluxe
   - ```sudo dpkg -i lsd_0.21.0_amd64.deb``` from [this release page](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd/releases) (adjust the package name if needed)
4. **[ls colors]** Install LS_COLORS
   - Download ```lscolors.sh``` from [this repo](https://github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS) and place it in your home directory ```~/``` or ```/home/<username>/```
5. **[config]** Apply my configurations
   - ```sh -c "$(curl -fsLS chezmoi.io/get)" -- init --apply sparcopt```
6. Reload your shell
   - ```source ~/.zshrc```  

#### Optional

## üî® WSL2 fixs
These are changes for WSL2 end users:

- [Fix Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) File Permissions](https://www.turek.dev/posts/fix-wsl-file-permissions/)
